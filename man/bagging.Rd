\title{Bagging for Decision Trees}
\usage{
bagging(t, B = 10, lambda = 0, random_subset = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{t}{The original decision tree.}

\item{B}{The number of bootstrap samples to generate. Default is 10.}

\item{lambda}{The complexity parameter for pruning in the case of regression trees. Default is 0.}
}
\value{
An ensemble model that combines the results of multiple bootstrapped decision trees.
}
\description{
Implements bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating) for decision trees, supporting both regression and classification tasks.
}
\examples{
# Assuming `tree` is an initialized decision tree object
ensemble_model <- bagging(tree, B = 20, lambda = 0.5)
}
